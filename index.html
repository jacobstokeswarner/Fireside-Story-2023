  <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
  <p>Everyone thought they were safe from the storm inside their cabins at camp Crystal Lake...</p>
  <p>The rain beat upon the tents of the teens, and as they huddled close to each other, one thought they heard a noise... "CH CH CH, HAH HAH HAH""...</p>
  <p>The teens were startled by an older woman, who claimed to be a caretaker, and was "just checking in" on what the teens were doing.</p>
  <p>Then, old Jimmy, that ornery rascal, was so startled by the old woman, that he punched her square in the face.</p>
